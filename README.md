# FATChess

Chess program built with Unity.  Engine and AI all built from scratch, no external chess libraries.  There is a prebuilt version here for mac machines, as well as the source code.  Please note that the source code is not up to date, as I lost the final version following an issue with my computer.  The version here is from somewhere in the middle of development, and is very messy.  The prebuilt version is built form the now lost final code version.

Note: For promotions, hold the key corresponding to the first letter of the piece you want to promote to (Q for queen, R for rook, K for knight, and B for bishop)

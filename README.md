Chess, but bad!

This is just a very simple chess program with AI that I created while teaching myself to code.
You play as white and the AI plays as black, the AI plays pretty fast so it shouldn't be too taxing on your computer.
It has all legal moves implemented, including castling, en passant, and promotions, although stalemates and things like the fifty move rule are not.
The codings is pretty awful, very inefficient and not well commented as these are quite literaly the first lines of code I wrote, and I taught myself along the way.
There is no windows version currently I'm having some trouble getting Unity to build to a windows version but I am working on fixing this.
If you find any bugs in the program, for example a move being made that shouldn't be possible, please leave a comment so I can fix it.

Note: For promotions, hold the key corresponding to the first letter of the piece you want to promote to (Q for queen, R for rook, K for knight, and B for bishop)

Thank you!
